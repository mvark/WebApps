# WebApps
Web Apps that I've created, enhanced or remixed through my collaboration with GitHub Copilot -
* Things Near Me uses the GeoNames API to find landmarks / interesting places around you while you're travelling.
* NutriScan uses the Open Food Facts API to detect whether a scanned food item is Ultra Processed or not.
