# WebApps
Web Apps that I've created, enhanced or remixed through my collaboration with GitHub Copilot -
1. [Bookmarker](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/Bookmarker) is a combination of Bookmarklet code & a Google App Script built API that saves bookmarks while automatically categorizing URLs using Gemini Flash API.
2. [BingeBuddy](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/BingeBuddy) is a light weight web application for searching movies, TV shows, and celebrities with streaming availability in India. Co-created with GitHub Copilot using vanilla JavaScript and powered by The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
3. [NutriScan](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/NutriScan) uses the Open Food Facts API to detect whether a scanned food item is Ultra Processed or not.
4. [People Tracker](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/PeopleTracker) is a simple bookmarklet that allows you to quickly save the URL, title, and your personal notes about any webpage (like a social media profile) directly into a Google Sheet. Your data stays in your own sheet and you can keep editing it whenever you like
5. [PhonaTick](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/PhonaTick) is a front-end for a list of words with tricky pronunciations fetched via a JSON API through Datasette
6. [GitHub User Roaster](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/blob/main/Roaster/README.md)  is a Streamlit app that fetches a GitHub user’s metadata via the GitHub API, analyzes recent public commits—highlighting coding patterns, quirky commit messages, and even emojis—and then uses Perplexity AI’s Sonar model to deliver a sharp, humorous “roast” of the user.
7. [Things Near Me](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/ThingsNearMe) uses the GeoNames API to find landmarks / interesting places around you while you're travelling.
8. [Whats In A Name](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/WhatsInAName) is a simple Flask app that uses the Sonar API from Perplexity.ai to fetch interesting, cultural, and historical facts about names.
9. [Where To Watch](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/WhereToWatch) is a simple tool to search for movies using the TMDB API, and check their streaming availability on popular Indian OTT platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, SonyLIV, Hotstar, and Zee5.
