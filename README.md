# WebApps
Web Apps that I've created, enhanced or remixed through my collaboration with GitHub Copilot -
1. [Bookmarker](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/Bookmarker) is a combination of Bookmarklet code & a Google App Script built API that saves bookmarks while automatically categorizing URLs using Gemini Flash API.
2. [NutriScan](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/NutriScan) uses the Open Food Facts API to detect whether a scanned food item is Ultra Processed or not.
3. [People Tracker](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/PeopleTracker) is a simple bookmarklet that allows you to quickly save the URL, title, and your personal notes about any webpage (like a social media profile) directly into a Google Sheet. Your data stays in your own sheet and you can keep editing it whenever you like
4. [PhonaTick](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/PhonaTick) is a front-end for a list of words with tricky pronunciations fetched via a JSON API through Datasette
5. [Things Near Me](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/ThingsNearMe) uses the GeoNames API to find landmarks / interesting places around you while you're travelling.
6. [Where To Watch](https://github.com/mvark/WebApps/tree/main/WhereToWatch) is a simple tool to search for movies using the TMDB API, and check their streaming availability on popular Indian OTT platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, SonyLIV, Hotstar, and Zee5.
