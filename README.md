# WebApps
Web Apps that I've created, enhanced or remixed through my collaboration with GitHub Copilot -
* Bookmarker is a combination of Bookmarklet code & a Google App Script built API that saves bookmarks while automatically categorizing URLs using Gemini Flash API.
* People Tracker is a simple bookmarklet that allows you to quickly save the URL, title, and your personal notes about any webpage (like a social media profile) directly into a Google Sheet. Your data stays in your own sheet and you can keep editing it whenever you like
* NutriScan uses the Open Food Facts API to detect whether a scanned food item is Ultra Processed or not.
* PhonaTick is a front-end for a list of words with tricky pronunciations fetched via a JSON API through Datasette
* Things Near Me uses the GeoNames API to find landmarks / interesting places around you while you're travelling.
